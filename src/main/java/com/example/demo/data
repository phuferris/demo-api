startDate = 2025-01-15
frequencyInDays = 30 days

fromDate = 2025-03-01
toDate = 2025-05-01

03/15, 04/15

Assume the host wants to pay when moving it on the startDate. Then the first payment will be on the start day, the next payment will be
n days from the startDay, where n = frequencyInDays.

What happen on the Feb 28 or 29th?

startData = 2025-01-15
scheduleDayOfMonth = 15


fromDateDayOfMonth = fromDate.dayOfMonth();

if (scheduleDayOfMonth = 15 > fromDateDayOfMonth = 01) {
    scheduledDay = fromDate.plusDay(scheduleDayOfMonth - fromDateOfMonth);
} else {
    // check to see
    scheduledDay = fromDate.plusDay(frequencyInDays - (fromDateOfMonth - scheduledDayOfMonth));
}

while (scheduledDate.isBehind(toDate) {
    add to the list;
}
